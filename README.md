The DSL IDE is an ElectricFlow plugin.  The plugin jar file is located in the 'out' directory. Once installed, the "DSL IDE" tab will appear on the ElectricFlow page.  It may be necessary to login to the ElectricFlow server again when launching the IDE.  Select the question mark icon for help.

This tool was developed during and Electric Cloud hackathon in August 2015.  While we feel it is useful in its current form, it is provided "as is" with no commitment to further support.
