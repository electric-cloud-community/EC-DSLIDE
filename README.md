CloudBees Flow DSL web-based editor and runner

The DSL IDE is an CloudBees Flow plugin.  Once installed, the "DSL IDE" tab will appear on the CloudBees Flow menu page.  It may be necessary to login to the CloudBees Flow server again when launching the DSL IDE.  Select the question mark icon for help.

This tool was developed during and Electric Cloud hackathon in August 2015.  While we feel it is useful in its current form, it is provided "as is" with little formal testing and no commitment to further support.  The web-based DSL editor is used extensively by the field engineers and has proven very useful for DSL development and interactive property expansion. Please feel free to offer suggestions in the form of Github project "Issues" or pull requests and will try to address them.
